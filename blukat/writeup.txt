- OK so there is a C code (like always)
- There is a key in here. The key is xored with something that I can't read. The xor's result must be a valid ASCII right? so techinicly it must be value between:
33 	21 	00100001 	&#33; 	! 	Exclamation mark

and
126 	7E 	01111110 	&#126; 	~ 	Tilde

- About 93 options. Well ok.
- I have an idea - I can try using a timeing attack in here - if strcmp is going charater by character - maybe I can mesure the time it takes.
- Using the time command we can do so! `time <command>`
